# ðŸŒŠ **PixelWave** ðŸŽ¨

Welcome to PixelWave! A space where the world of code meets the art of creativity.

The goal is to explore, learn, and push the boundaries of **creative coding** through various JavaScript libraries like [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), and many more! Diving into the realms of **generative art**, **interactive simulations**, and **algorithmic designs**.

### **What We Do**:
- **Creative Coding**: Bridging the gap between art and technology.
- **Interactive Simulations**: Building dynamic and interactive worlds.
- **Generative Art**: Using algorithms to create beauty from randomness.
- **Web Components**: Crafting unique web experiences through code.

ðŸŽ¨ **Letâ€™s bring pixels to life, one wave at a time.**
